# Preventive Maintenance using Machine Learning

## Description
This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts whether a machine will fail in the near future based on live data. It leverages advanced algorithms to enable proactive maintenance and minimize downtime.

## Features
- Predicts potential machine failures.
- Processes live data from machines.
- Customizable for different use cases.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages & Libraries**: 
  - [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
  - [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
  - SVC Algorithm
- **Tools**:
  - [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/)
  - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - [Thonny](https://thonny.org/)
  - [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

## Usage
- To build the model for a custom dataset, run the `.ipynb` file in this repository.
- Alternatively, use the live demo hosted on Streamlit:
